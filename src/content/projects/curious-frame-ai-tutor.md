Frederic Collonval created a screen-free AI tutor for children that uses a handheld cardboard frame to identify everyday objects and explain them through voice in multiple languages, all running locally on Jetson Orin Nano.

The system uses moondream2 VLM for object detection, Gemma 3n LLM via Ollama for generating age-appropriate explanations, and Piper TTS for voice output. A clever flag-based interface allows children to switch between languages, turning it into both an educational tool and a language-learning device.

### Features

- Screen-free interaction for healthy child development
- moondream2 vision-language model for object detection
- Gemma 3n LLM for child-safe, age-appropriate explanations
- Piper TTS for natural voice narration
- Multilingual support with visual language switching
- Fully offline operation on Jetson Orin Nano 8GB
- Simple cardboard frame interface requiring no complex input
- Automated setup script for easy deployment
