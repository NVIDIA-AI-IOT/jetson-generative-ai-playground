# Tutorial - SAM (Segment Anything)

Let's run [`TAM`](https://github.com/gaomingqi/Track-Anything) to perform Segment Anything on videos on NVIDIA Jetson.

!!! abstract "What you need"

    1. One of the following Jetson:

        <span class="blobDarkGreen4">Jetson AGX Orin (64GB)</span>
        <span class="blobDarkGreen5">Jetson AGX Orin (32GB)</span>

    2. Running one of the following versions of [JetPack](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack):

        <span class="blobPink1">JetPack 5 (L4T r35.x)</span>

    3. Sufficient storage space (preferably with NVMe SSD).

        - `6.8GB` for container image
        - Spaces for models

    4. Clone and setup [`jetson-containers`](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-containers/blob/master/docs/setup.md){:target="_blank"}:
    
		```bash
		git clone https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-containers
		bash jetson-containers/install.sh
		``` 

## How to start

Use the `jetson-containers run` and `autotag` commands to automatically pull or build a compatible container image.

```
jetson-containers run $(autotag tam)
```

The container has a default run command (`CMD`) that will automatically start TAM's web server.

Open your browser and access `http://<IP_ADDRESS>:12212`.

## TAM web UI

Check out the [official tutorial](https://github.com/gaomingqi/Track-Anything/blob/master/doc/tutorials.md) to learn how to operate the web UI.

## Troubleshooting

### `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: './checkpoints/E2FGVI-HQ-CVPR22.pth'`

You may find the TAM app fails to download a checkpoint file `E2FGVI-HQ-CVPR22.pth`.

```
Downloading checkpoints from Google Drive... tips: If you cannot see the progress bar, please try to download it manuall               and put it in the checkpointes directory. E2FGVI-HQ-CVPR22.pth: https://github.com/MCG-NKU/E2FGVI(E2FGVI-HQ model)
Access denied with the following error:

        Cannot retrieve the public link of the file. You may need to change
        the permission to 'Anyone with the link', or have had many accesses. 

You may still be able to access the file from the browser:

         https://drive.google.com/uc?id=10wGdKSUOie0XmCr8SQ2A2FeDe-mfn5w3 

```

You can manually download the checkpoint file on your Docker host machine.

```
cd jetson-containers/
pip install gdown
source ~/.profile
gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=10wGdKSUOie0XmCr8SQ2A2FeDe-mfn5w3 
mv E2FGVI-HQ-CVPR22.pth ./data/models/tam/
```

And you can try running the TAM container.

```
jetson-containers run $(autotag tam)
```
