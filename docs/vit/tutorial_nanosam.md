# Tutorial - NanoSAM

Let's run NVIDIA's [NanoSAM](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/nanosam) to check out the performance gain by distillation.

!!! abstract "What you need"

    1. One of the following Jetson:

        <span class="blobDarkGreen4">Jetson AGX Orin (64GB)</span>
        <span class="blobDarkGreen5">Jetson AGX Orin (32GB)</span>
        <span class="blobLightGreen3">Jetson Orin NX (16GB)</span>
        <span class="blobLightGreen4">Jetson Orin Nano (8GB)</span>

    2. Running one of the following versions of [JetPack](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack):

        <span class="blobPink1">JetPack 5 (L4T r35.x)</span>
        <span class="blobPink2">JetPack 6 (L4T r36.x)</span>

    3. Sufficient storage space (preferably with NVMe SSD).

        - `6.3GB` for container image
        - Spaces for models

    4. Clone and setup [`jetson-containers`](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-containers/blob/master/docs/setup.md){:target="_blank"}:
    
		```bash
		git clone https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-containers
		bash jetson-containers/install.sh
		``` 

## How to start

Use the `jetson-containers run` and `autotag` commands to automatically pull or build a compatible container image.

```
jetson-containers run $(autotag nanosam)
```

## Run examples

Inside the container, you can move to `/opt/nanosam` directory, to go through all the examples demonstrated on the repo.

```
cd /opt/nanosam
```

To run the "[**Example 1 - Segment with bounding box**](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/nanosam#example-1---segment-with-bounding-box)":

```
python3 examples/basic_usage.py \
    --image_encoder="data/resnet18_image_encoder.engine" \
    --mask_decoder="data/mobile_sam_mask_decoder.engine"
```

The result is saved under `/opt/nanosam/data/basic_usage_out.jpg`.

To check on your host machine, you can copy that into `/data` directory of the container where that is mounted from the host.

```
cp data/basic_usage_out.jpg /data/
```

Then you can go to your host system, and find the file under `jetson-containers/data/basic_usage_out.jpg`
