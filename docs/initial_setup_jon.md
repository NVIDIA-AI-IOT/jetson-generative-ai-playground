## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Check if Jetson UEFI Firmware version > `36.0`

Your Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit may have the latest firmware ("Jetson UEFI firmware" on QSPI-NOR flash memory) flashed at the factory.

If not, we need to go through a set of procedures to upgrade to the latest firmware. (Luckily, we can now do this all just on Jetson, meaning we don't need to use a host Ubuntu PC any more!)

So let's first check the version of your Jetson UEFI Firmware.<br>
You can take one of the following methods.

=== ":material-monitor: Monitor-attached"

    1. Connect your monitor and USB keyboard to your developer kit.
    2. Turn on the developer kit by plugging in the bundled DC power supply
    3. Repeatedly press ++esc++ key on the keyboard, especially after NVIDIA logo boot splash screen first appears on the monitor
    4. You should see UEFI setup menu screen
    5. Check the third line from the top (below "Not specified"), which should be the version number of Jetson UEFI firmware

    > Below image shows that this Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit unit has the old UEFI firmware, indicating that the unit first needs its firmware/QSPI updated in order to run JetPack 6.x.
    ![computer screen showing UEFI menu](images/vlcsnap-2025-01-09-15h00m32s319.png){ width="960" }

=== ":material-monitor-off: Headless"

    1. Connect USB to TTL Serial cable onto the following pins on `J14` "button" header of carrier board located under the Jetson module.
          - `RXD` (Pin 3) :fontawesome-solid-arrows-left-right: Adafruit adaptor cable <span class="blobGreen">Green</span>
          - `TXD` (Pin 4) :fontawesome-solid-arrows-left-right: Adafruit adaptor cable <span class="blobWhite">White</span>
          - `GND` (Pin 7) :fontawesome-solid-arrows-left-right: Adafruit adaptor cable <span class="blobBlack">Black</span>

        [![](./images/jon_adafruit_uart_cable.jpg){ width="640" }](./images/jon_adafruit_uart_cable.jpg)
        > For the detail, refer to [Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit Carrier Board Specification](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/downloads#?search=Carrier%20Board%20Specification&tx=$product,jetson_orin_nano).
    1. On your PC, run your console monitor program and open the USB serial port.
    2. Power on the developer kit by plugging in the bundled DC power supply
    3. On the PC console, repeatedly press ++esc++ key on the keyboard, especially after NVIDIA logo boot splash screen first appears on the monitor
    4. You should see UEFI setup menu screen
    5. Check the third line from the top (below "Not specified"), which should be the version number of Jetson UEFI firmware

=== "üòÅI'm feeling lucky"

    !!! danger "Warning"

        <B>Avoid leaving the device in a black screen state for extended periods or attempting to boot repeatedly with an SD card containing an incompatible JetPack version.</B>

        There is a chance that accumulated boot failures may trigger the L4T launcher to always boot into recovery kernel.

        If this happens, even after switching to the proper JetPack 5.1.3 SD card, it won't boot from the SD card until we manually change the L4T Launcher setting.

    Although we don't recommend for the above stated reason, you could skip to [***6Ô∏è‚É£ Boot with JetPack 6.x SD card***](#6-boot-with-jetpack-6x-sd-card), and try your luck to see if your Jetson just boots with the JetPack 6.x SD card.

    If the Ubuntu desktop does not appear within 3 minutes and the screen remains black (as shown below), it indicates that the unit is running an older UEFI firmware version that is incompatible with the JetPack 6.x SD card.

    ![alt text](images/uefi_interactive_shell.png){ width="640" }

    Turn the unit off, and skip to the next section ([2Ô∏è‚É£ Boot with JetPack 5.1.3 SD card to schedule firmware update](#2-boot-with-jetpack-513-sd-card-to-schedule-firmware-update)).


## Determine QSPI update is necessary or not

!!! warning "Attention"

    Select the appropriate tab below based on your firmware version you found in the above step.

    If you found your Jetson Orin Nano needs its firmware updated to run JetPack 6.x, click [":material-update: Firmware < 36.0"](#__tabbed_2_1) tab, and then additional step 2 to 5 will appear for you to follow.

    If you know your Jetson Orin Nano has the latest firmware, stay on [":fontawesome-solid-forward-fast: Firmware 36.x"](#__tabbed_2_2) tab, and skip to the next section ([***6Ô∏è‚É£ Boot with JetPack 6.x SD card***](#6-boot-with-jetpack-6x-sd-card))

=== ":material-update: Firmware < 36.0"

    Your Jetson Orin Nano **needs** its firmware updated in order to make JetPack 6.x SD card work.

    Perform the following steps (2 to 5).

    ## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Boot with JetPack 5.1.3 SD card to schedule firmware update

    First, we need to run JetPack 5.1.3 in order to let its `nvidia-l4t-bootloader` package get its bootloader/firmware updater activated, so that the firmware update automatically runs the next time it reboots.

    1. Download SD card image on to your PC

        On your PC, download JetPack 5.1.3 image for Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit from the official [JetPack 5.1.3 page](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack-sdk-513) or from the below direct link button.

        !!! warning

            NVIDIA had updated the JetPack 5.1.3 image on 5/28/2024, as the old version had some issue and the following process did not work.<br>So please download and use the latest image (the new file name is **`JP513-orin-nano-sd-card-image_b29.zip`**).

        [Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit<br>JetPack 5.1.3 image](https://developer.nvidia.com/downloads/embedded/l4t/r35_release_v5.0/jp513-orin-nano-sd-card-image.zip){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

    2. Use Balena Etcher to flash image to SD card

        If you don't have Balena Etcher on your PC, download from [Balena official site](https://etcher.balena.io/).

        ![alt text](images/balena_etcher.png){ width="360" }

    3. Insert the flashed microSD card into the slot on Jetson module

        ![](./images/jetson-orin-nano-dev-kit-sd-slot.png){ width="360" }

    4. Power-on

        Turn on the Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit **with JetPack 5.1.3 SD card inserted** by plugging in the DC power supply.

    5. Complete the initial software setup (`oem-config`)

        !!! info

            There is a chance that JetPack 5.1.3 SD card does not show any desktop UI on the attached display (the display remains black).

            It would still schedule the UEFI firmware update in the background, so when you power cycle the unit, most likely it will perform the firmware update on the next boot up.

            So if this happens, skip to the next step ([Step 3Ô∏è‚É£](#3-reboot-and-observe-firmware-update-to-50)'s bullet point `2`.).

    6. Ensure firmware update is scheduled.

        Once Jetson boots into Jetson Linux system, a background service automatically runs to schedule a firmware update (if needed) to be performed during the next boot-up process.

        Once you see the following, or just wait about 5 minutes after powering on to ensure the scheduling is done, reboot.

        === ":material-monitor: GUI"

            ![](./images/nvidia-l4t-bootloader-post-install-notification.png)

        === ":material-monitor-off: CUI"

            Main PID: 11439 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
            ```

    ## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Reboot and observe firmware update to `5.0`

    1. Reboot

        Reboot your Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit.

        === ":material-monitor: GUI"

            On the Ubuntu desktop click the power icon (:material-power:) and select "**Restart...**".

        === ":material-monitor-off: CUI"

            ```bash
            $ sudo reboot
            ```

    2. Observe firmware update

        You should see the following during the boot up process.

        === ":material-monitor: With monitor"

            ![](./images/fw-update_from_3-0.JPG)

        === ":material-monitor-off: Headless (serial)"

            ![](./images/fw_update_4.1-to-5.0.png)

        Once done, you will boot into JetPack 5.1.3 (again), with underlying firmware updated to `5.0-35550185`.

    ## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run QSPI Updater package to schedule QSPI update

    Now that your UEFI firmware is updated to 35.5.0 ( = JetPack 5.1.3 ), it is capable of updating the entire QSPI content to make it ready for JetPack 6.x.

    We will run a special tool so that the entire QSPI update is scheduled to run automatically on the next boot-up.

    1. Double-check your firmware version is up to date (`35.5.0` = JetPack 5.1.3)

        Once it reboots back into Jetson Linux system, on Jetson terminal, run the following:

        ```bash
        sudo nvbootctrl dump-slots-info
        ```

        You should see something like the following, with the **Current version** indicating `35.5.0`.

        ``` { .yaml .no-select }
        Current version: 35.5.0
        Capsule update status: 0
        Current bootloader slot: A
        Active bootloader slot: A
        num_slots: 2
        slot: 0,             status: normal
        slot: 1,             status: normal
        ```

    2. Install QSPI Updater Debian package to trigger the entire QSPI update

        On Jetson terminal, run the following:

        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install nvidia-l4t-jetson-orin-nano-qspi-updater
        ```

        Installing the `nvidia-l4t-jetson-orin-nano-qspi-updater` automatically runs its script to schedule the entire QSPI update to be performed during the next boot process, so that the firmware is ready for JetPack 6.x.

    ## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Reboot, observe QSPI update, and power off

    1. Reboot

        Once the QSPI update is scheduled, reboot your Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit.

    2. Observe update

        You can observe the QSPI update during the boot up process.

    3. Power off

        Once the update is done, it reboots and tries to boot, however it will get stuck **UNLESS you change the SD card to JetPack 6.x one**.

        Therefore you should just power off the developer kit simply by disconnecting the DC power supply.

        !!! danger "Attention"

            This part may look very confusing as neither the attached monitor nor the debug UART shows any explicit message on what action to take next.

            What is going on here is that the Jetson's firmware (inside the QSPI-NOR flash memory) is now updated, ready for the JetPack 6.x SD card, however it is now incompatible with JetPack 5.1.3 SD card left in the Jetson module's slot, so after the reboot it gets stuck in the boot process.

            So there is no issue with this boot halt (or endless rebooting). <br>
            Simply power off the device and insert the new SD card.

=== ":fontawesome-solid-forward-fast: Firmware 36.x"

    > Your Jetson Orin Nano has the latest firmware that is ready for JetPack 6.x SD card.

    > Skip to the next section ([***6Ô∏è‚É£ Boot with JetPack 6.x SD card***](#6-boot-with-jetpack-6x-sd-card))


## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Boot with JetPack 6.x SD card

Once we know the onboard firmware is up-to-date and ready for JetPack 6.x, we can boot Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit with a microSD card for JetPack 6.2.

1. Download SD card image on to your PC

    On your PC, download the latest JetPack 6.x image for Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit from the official [JetPack page](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack) or from the below direct link button.

    [Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit<br>JetPack 6.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/downloads/embedded/l4t/r36_release_v4.3/jp62-orin-nano-sd-card-image.zip){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

2. Use Balena Etcher to flash image to SD card

    Insert your microSD card into your PC's SD card slot, and use Balena Etcher to flash the SD card with the image you just downloaded.

    If you don't have Balena Etcher on your PC, download from [Balena official site](https://etcher.balena.io/).

        ```

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Reboot and observe firmware update to `36.4.3`

1. Reboot your Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit on JetPack 6.1 (rev.1) SD card to trigger the final firmware update (to `36.4.2`).

    === ":material-monitor: GUI"

        On the Ubuntu desktop click the power icon (:material-power:) and select "**Restart...**".

    === ":material-monitor-off: CUI"

        ```bash
        $ sudo reboot
        ```

2. Observe firmware update

    You should see the following during the boot up process.

    === ":material-monitor: With monitor"

        ![alt text](images/fw-update_from_36-3-0.JPG){ width="800" }

    === ":material-monitor-off: Headless (serial)"

Once done, you will boot into JetPack 6.1 (rev.1) again, with the underlying firmware updated to `36.4.2`, which unlock the Super performance.

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Unlock Super Performance

!!! warning "Attention"

    If your are booting with ***JetPack 6.1 (rev.1)*** SD card instead of JetPack 6.2 SD card, you may need to execute the following command after the final login and reboot your device.

    This ensures that the **MAXN** performance mode becomes available on your system.

    ```bash
    sudo rm -rf /etc/nvpmodel.conf
    ```

### Switch to MAXN SUPER mode
