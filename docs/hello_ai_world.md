# Hello AI World

[Hello AI World](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference){:target="_blank"} is an in-depth tutorial series for DNN-based inference and training of image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and more.  It is built on the [`jetson-inference`](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference){:target="_blank"} library using TensorRT for optimized performance on Jetson.
