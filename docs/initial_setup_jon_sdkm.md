![](./images/m48-workstation-256px-blk.png){ width="256"  align=right}

!!! note
    This guide is to supplement the official [**Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit Getting Started Guide**](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-orin-nano-devkit).

The NVIDIA¬Æ <span class="blobLightGreen4">Jetson Orin Nano‚Ñ¢ Developer Kit</span> is a perfect kit to start your journey of local generative AI evaluation and development.

This guide explains the **alternative method** for setting up Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit by flashing both the latest firmware (QSPI image) and the latest JetPack all at once, using a host x86 PC.

## Check your toolbox

The following item is needed or highly desired for flashing your Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit using your host PC.

If you don't have them, check the [default microSD-only setup instruction](./initial_setup_jon.md) or you want to arrange them first then return to this guide once they are available. 

!!! warning "What not come in the box - What you need/want to prepare"   

    ### Host PC

    - :material-checkbox-intermediate: x86 PC running **Ubuntu 22.04** or **Ubuntu 20.04**

    ### Storage
    
    Either of the following.

    - :material-checkbox-blank-outline: microSD card (64GB or bigger) 
    - :material-checkbox-blank-outline: NVMe SSD (Recommended for better performance)

    <img src="images/microsd_64gb.png" style="max-width:120px;">  <img src="images/ssd_nvme_1tb.png" style="max-width:540px;">

    ### Flashing supply

    - :material-checkbox-blank-outline: USB cable (USB-C plug for Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit side, other end depends on your PC)
    - :material-checkbox-blank-outline: jumper pin (or metal paper clip)

    ### Mean to access terminal

    You need either of the following set:

    - :material-checkbox-blank-outline: DisplayPort cable,  DisplayPort capable monitor and a USB keyboard
    - :material-checkbox-blank-outline: DisplayPort to HDMI cable and HDMI capable monitor (or TV) and a USB keyboard
    - :material-checkbox-blank-outline: [USB to TTL Serial cable :octicons-link-external-16:](https://www.adafruit.com/product/954) (Advanced)

    ## üöÄ Default method : microSD card only setup method

    In case you **do NOT** have an x86 PC running Ubuntu 22.04 or 20.04, you can fall back to the default "microSD card only" setup method that does not require any host PC.

    The decision process can look like this.

## 0Ô∏è‚É£ Install SDK Manager

!!! info "Reference"

    :octicons-link-external-16: [NVIDIA SDK Manager Documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/sdk-manager/){:target="_blank"} : <br> :material-chevron-double-right: **Download and Install** :material-chevron-double-right: [Download and Run SDK Manager](https://docs.nvidia.com/sdk-manager/download-run-sdkm/index.html){:target="_blank"}

On your Ubuntu 22.04 / 20.04 PC, open a terminal and execute the following command.

Select the tab that matches your Ubuntu version.

=== ":simple-ubuntu: Ubuntu 22.04"

    ```bash
    wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
    sudo dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get -y install sdkmanager
    ```

=== ":simple-ubuntu: Ubuntu 20.04"

    ```bash
    wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2004/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
    sudo dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Connect the Target Hardware

Once SDK Manager is launched, connect your Jetson developer kit to your Ubuntu PC and power it on in Forced Recovery mode.

1. Connect your Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit to your PC with a USB cable.<br>Note that the USB cable goes into the USB-C port of the carrier board of the developer kit.

2. While shorting `pin 9` and `pin 10` of `J14` header located below the Jetson module using a jumper pin, insert the DC power supply plug into the DC jack of the carrier board to power it on.

    You can use a paper clip like a photo below as well. 

    ![Jumpering pins](images/jon_jumper.png){ width="640" }

3. Select "**Jetson Orin Nano \[8GB developer kit version\]**" and hit "**OK**"

    ![alt text](<images/Screenshot from 2025-01-06 21-50-49.png>){ width="480" }

4. Uncheck "**Host Machine**" and it should now look like this

    ![alt text](<images/Screenshot from 2025-01-06 21-54-47.png>)

5. Click "**Continue**" button to proceed to the next step.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Select Software Components to Install]

1. Leave the only "**Jetson Linux**" component checked, and uncheck everything.

    ![alt text](<images/Screenshot from 2025-01-06 21-58-45.png>)

2. Remember to also check "**I accept the terms and conditions of the license agreements**".

3. Click "**Continue**" button to proceed to the next step.

4. It will prompt for the `sudo` command password.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Download on Host PC

1. It will start downloading the "BSP" package and "RootFS" package.

    ![alt text](<images/Screenshot from 2025-01-06 21-59-14.png>)

2. Once downloads are complete, it will untar the package and start generating the images to flash in the background.

    ![alt text](<images/Screenshot from 2025-01-06 22-03-29.png>)

3. Once images are ready, SDK it will open the prompt for flashing.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Boot and Initial Setup

1. If still plugged, remove the jumper from header (that was used to put it in Forced Recovery mode)

2. Connect the DisplayPort cable or adapter and USB keyboard and mouse to Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit, or hook up the USB to TTL Serial cable.

3. Unplug the power supply and put back in to power cycle.

4. Jetson should now boot into the Jetson Linux (BSP) of your selected JetPack version from the storage of your choice.

5. Complete the initial software setup (`oem-config`)

### Switch to MAXN mode

Note that the default power mode is **15W**. <br>
To switch to the new power mode and unlock the increased performance, follow below steps:

1. Click on the current power mode (**15W**) by clicking the NVIDIA icon on the right side of the Ubuntu desktop‚Äôs top bar.
2. Select **Power mode** from the menu.
3. Choose **MAXN** to enable maximum performance.
